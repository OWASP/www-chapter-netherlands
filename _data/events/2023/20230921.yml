                      Dev[Sec]Ops has embraced CI/CD's build, test and deployment approach, now pushing 
                      secure test automation into the dev's build pipelines.<br />
                      Now with SCA added to the xAST security verification in your pipeline, as more is 
                      better, right?<br />
                      But, without clear expectation what to expect from your tool (usage), how to choose 
                      the right tool?<br />
                      During this presentation, you will be guided to define the problem first, in order 
                      to choose the tools to solve it. Let's grow maturity and not push on security test 
                      automation in the development pipelines but adding useful quality assurance in your 
                      production line!
