                      Back in 2018 I wrote&#58; “In today’s multi-sourced 
                      enterprise, your security is as good as your worst 
                      written contract.” We have gotten better at writing 
                      security into commercial contracts since I first 
                      did my talk on this topic, but the yellow brick 
                      road ahead of us still goes some ways.<br />
                      <br />
                      But how about AppSec, how well is it covered in 
                      our IT contracts? What are the pitfalls and the 
                      solutions? How do we avoid that someone else’s 
                      security issues become our security problems? And, 
                      by all means, let’s learn how to be a bit lazy, 
                      and do better with less effort!

                        Manager at Canon EMEA, Sebastian has been in 
                        IT and Security for over 20 years, covering a 
                        multitude of roles ranging from Developer, 
                        Security Architect, Auditor and Consultant, 
                        before moving into security governance and 
                        management, giving him a unique multi-faceted 
                        view on today&#8217;s InfoSec challenges. He has 
                        led multiple security improvement programs 
                        and performed maturity assessments for a wide 
                        variety of organizations - while continuously 
                        asking himself&#58;&#8217;&#8217;Could we do 
                        this in another way?&#8217;&#8217;

    title           : About containers and their escapes&#58; understanding escape patterns and possibilities
    start           : "20:15"

    abstract        : >-
                      Containers have become one of the most common 
                      underlying infrastructure for microservice 
                      architectures. As such, they can often be part 
                      of the external attack surface of enterprise 
                      systems and applications (e.g., whenever a web 
                      application hosted on a kubernetes cluster is 
                      Internet-facing). Thus, it is important to 
                      understand what types of (mis)configurations 
                      can make containers more vulnerable against 
                      attacks of different types. In this talk, 
                      Mauricio will deep dive into different techniques 
                      that can be used to escape containers. In 
                      particular, he will talk about how to escape 
                      privileged containers, the usage of different 
                      capabilities, the usage of kernel exploits and a 
                      few other ways in which attackers may use to gain 
                      access to the hosts of the containers.

                        Mauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on 
                        container technologies. In particular, he focuses 
                        on the security of containers and serverless 
                        architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes 
                        clusters and serverless architectures for several

                        his security work, he has a background in 
                        academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the 
                        University of Groningen, focused on programming 
                        language design and formal methods to ensure 
                        correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys 
                        reading, cooking, and solving puzzles.
