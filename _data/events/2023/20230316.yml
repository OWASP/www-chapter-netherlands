                      With the recent breaches to Optus, Twitter, and 
                      T-Mobile, 2023 is destined to become the year 
                      API security becomes the number one concern for 
                      organizations, both at the board level and within 
                      security and development teams. API security 
                      poses unique challenges to builders and defenders, 
                      and many of your existing detection and protection 
                      measures may prove to be ineffective.<br />
                      <br />
                      Join Colin as he draws on his experience from 
                      curating the industry&apos;s biggest API security 
                      resource (APISecurity.io) in exploring the 
                      following&#58;<br />
                      Crash course on the OWASP API Security Top 10 
                      (and how it differs from the OWASP Top 10)<br />
                      A whistle-stop tour of some of the biggest API 
                      breaches over the past 18 months, taking a look 
                      at what went wrong, the impact, and most 
                      importantly, how to prevent such attacks.<br />
                      Finally, he will present the top techniques for 
                      protecting your APIs from attack, starting 
                      with secure development practices through to 
                      API protection and threat detection.<br />
                      <br />
                      The content will be technical, with demos and 
                      code samples, and based on real-world breaches. 
                      By the end of the session, you will have an 
                      understanding of the API Security Top 10, and 
                      have a working knowledge of how to protect your 
                      APIs, either at a code level or using runtime 
                      protections.

    title           : Managing APIs securely
    start           : "20:15"

    abstract        : >-
                      When an organization offers an API, the API needs 
                      to become a Managed API. This means that lifecycle 
                      management, security, and throttling resources 
                      become an important aspect of API Management, as 
                      well as the ability of developers to find, explore 
                      and subscribe to the API to use them.<br />
                      <br />
                      During the presentation, Rob will zoom into these 
                      aspects and how an API Manager can help you with 
                      security and throttling (including schema validation 
                      and advanced scenarios) while at the same time 
                      making the API easily available to your target 
                      developers (inside or outside the organization).<br />
                      <br />
                      In the second part, he will elaborate on the 
                      “shiny frontend / dirty backend”. This is an API 
                      frontend that accesses legacy systems, databases, 
                      but also the integration of a set of APIs etc., 
                      thus enabling services that use older technology or 
                      proprietary interfaces to have a modern appearance 
                      to the outside world, e.g. exposing a legacy 
                      insurance policy administration system as an API.<br />
                      <br />
                      Thirdly, we will look at the way you can implement 
                      the Mastodon API. Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter l
                      ast year, alternative platforms like Mastodon have 
                      become more popular. It might be that this becomes 
                      a viable channel to communicate with clients for 
                      some organizations.
