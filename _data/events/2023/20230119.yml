    title           : Bootstrap and increase your software assurance with OWASP SAMM v2.1
    abstract        : >-
                      With our new release OWASP SAMM v2.1 - the prime maturity model for 
                      software assurance - we provide an effective and measurable way for 
                      all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software 
                      security posture.<br />
                      <br />
                      OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including 
                      development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. 
                      It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.<br />
                      <br />
                      During this talk Sebastien (project co-leader) will explain how to use 
                      SAMM in your organization. And then continue on the added features in 
                      our new release 2.1&#58;<br />

                      BSIMM, …)<br />

                      PDF and the updated toolbox.<br />
                      <br />
                      We will conclude with the outcome of our 2022 SAMM survey and the 
                      rebooted SAMM benchmark initiative.
