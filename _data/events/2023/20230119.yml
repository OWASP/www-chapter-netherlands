    title           : Bootstrap and increase your software assurance with OWASP SAMM v2.1
    abstract        : >-
                      With our new release OWASP SAMM v2.1 - the prime maturity model for 
                      software assurance - we provide an effective and measurable way for 
                      all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software 
                      security posture.<br />
                      <br />
                      OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including 
                      development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. 
                      It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.<br />
                      <br />
                      During this talk Sebastien (project co-leader) will explain how to use 
                      SAMM in your organization. And then continue on the added features in 
                      our new release 2.1&#58;<br />

                      OWASP projects and content references<br />
                      Mappings to other standards and models (including NIST SSDF, ISO27001, 
                      BSIMM, …)<br />

                      <br />
                      We will conclude with the outcome of our 2022 SAMM survey and the

    title           : OWASP Security Knowledge Framework
    abstract        : >-
                      Education is the first step in the Secure Software Development Lifecycle. 
                      The free OWASP Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) is intended to be a 
                      tool that is used as a guide for building and verifying secure software. 
                      It can also be used to train developers about application security. This 
                      talk will help you as a developer to become THE Neo of your development 
                      team. We will show how you can do security by design and introduce other 
                      quality gates into your development pipeline to ensure high end quality 
                      and security of your project.
