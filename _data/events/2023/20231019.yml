                      Security misconfigurations are often easy to exploit but 
                      also easy to avoid. How can we raise security awareness 
                      and at the same time prevent security misconfigurations 
                      (such as leaked credentials) from reaching production? 
                      Is there an easy way to scan, triage and follow-up on 
                      exposed secrets at enterprise scale? ABN Amro open 
                      sourced Repository Scanner and runs Repository Scanner 
                      internally at scale, exposing secrets in source code 
                      repositories and thereby raising security awareness while 
                      at the same time improving the security posture by 
                      remediating security misconfigurations.
