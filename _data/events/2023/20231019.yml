                      In this talk, we will discuss the hacking of CI/CD orchestrators, 
                      with a focus on GitHub actions and what kind of things can be done 
                      from the perspective of a malicious insider. Some of the cases we 
                      will discuss are&#58;<br /> 
                      - Secret enumeration.<br />
                      - Accessing infrastructure through runners.<br />
                      - Public runners vs Private runners.<br />
                      - Code injection in the pipeline and supply chain.<br />
                      - GitHub commits information.<br />
                      - Secret searching in the repository.<br />
                      The goal is to provide a broad view on the attack surface that can 
                      be derived from CI/CD orchestrators and their runners, as well as 
                      to show a few demos on how this can be done.

                        Mauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. 
                        In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless 
                        architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless 
                        architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior 
                        to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in 
                        Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming 
                        language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare 
                        time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles.

                      Security misconfigurations are often easy to exploit but 
                      also easy to avoid. How can we raise security awareness 
                      and at the same time prevent security misconfigurations 
                      (such as leaked credentials) from reaching production? 
                      Is there an easy way to scan, triage and follow-up on 
                      exposed secrets at enterprise scale? ABN Amro open 
                      sourced Repository Scanner and runs Repository Scanner 
                      internally at scale, exposing secrets in source code 
                      repositories and thereby raising security awareness while 
                      at the same time improving the security posture by 
                      remediating security misconfigurations.
