    title           : OWASP Juice Shop
    abstract        : >-
                      OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure 
                      web application! It can be used in security training, awareness demos, 
                      CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools!<br />
                      <br />
                      Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten 
                      along with many other security flaws found in real-world 
                      applications!<br />
                      <br />
                      At this event, we will take a tour through the application, hack it 
                      live on screen, learn about Coding Challenges, CTF mode, cheat detection, 
                      custom theming, and more!

    title           : The Rise of the Security Verification Standard
    abstract        : >-
                      We are currently seeing a big uptick in the progression of the OWASP 
                      Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) as well as the Mobile 
                      version (MASVS). Not only are two major releases in the pipeline (5.0 
                      and 2.0 respectively) but we are now seeing industry stand up, take 
                      notice and start expecting more from applications, based on these 
                      standards. In this talk, Josh Grossman (one of the ASVS project leaders) 
                      will take you through these key developments including our vision for 
                      the upcoming version 5.0 of the ASVS and how you and your employer can 
                      be involved in the final release.<br />
                      This will also be a chance to hear first-hand about a couple of new 
                      programmes where you will see the SVSs being more widely used and 
                      required and how you can prepare your organizations for this significant 
                      impact this will have, whether you are developing applications or you 
                      are assessing them.
