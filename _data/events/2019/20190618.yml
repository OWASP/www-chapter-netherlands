                        In the daytime, Martijn is a pen tester at Qbit Cyber Security, and 
                        by night he is bug bounty hunting in the wild and sending PoCs to 
                        Detectify Crowdsource and other bug bounty platforms. Recon is key for 
                        finding vulnerabilities yet is tedious at times. Hackers, like developers, 
                        find that automation makes life easier, even recon. Martijn has developed 
                        something called ReconPi, a bug bounty reconnaissance tool that automates 
                        most of the (general) recon methods that hackers use. He’ll show you how 
                        he does all his recon, yes everything, on a Raspberry Pi 3 in his lightning

                      So what’s has a JQuery bug that affected thousands of websites with one of 
                      the highest starred GitHub repos with 7,800 forks, a Domain Name Registrar 
                      vulnerability which allowed for full access to domain owner details (post GDPR) 
                      and data protection flaws within Microsoft’s Office365 all have in common? … 
                      Answer&58; Responsible Disclosure. This talk will feature disclosure on each of 
                      the bugs and others, the circumstances around these when reporting, to highlight 
                      the problems security researchers face today when trying to do the right thing 
                      and to raise awareness of the security flaws so we are better protected.
