    title           : Machine Learning vs. Cryptocoin Miners
    abstract        : >-
                      With the advent of cryptocurrencies as a prevalent economic entity, 
                      attackers have begun turning compromised boxes and environments into 
                      cash via cryptocoin mining. This has given rise for the necessity to 
                      detect compromised environments by analyzing network traffic logs for 
                      evidence of cryptocoin miners operating within a given network. In 
                      this talk, I’ll be reviewing various ML and statistical analysis 
                      techniques leveraged against VPC Flow Logs for this very purpose. It 
                      will not be a deep dive of the math involved, but instead a general 
                      discussion of these techniques and why I chose them.

      bio             : >-
                        Jonn Callahan has worked in appsec for half a decade across a wide 
                        variety of languages, technologies, and sectors. While constantly 
                        looking for new things to play with, he rediscovered his love for 
                        the universal language of math and, consequentially, the power of 
                        statistical analysis and machine learning. He now seeks to dismantle 
                        the black magic of these techniques, showing that they don’t require 
                        an advanced mathematics degree to be leveraged, as well as to find 
                        novel ways to apply them within the security space

    title           : Running at Light Speed&#58; Cloud Native Security Patterns
    start           : "20:15"

                      No matter how fast you ship software, a good design is critical to security. 
                      Cloud native systems are no exception. Containerized microservices running on 
                      distributed management and orchestration platforms, bring new challenges to 
                      address as well as classic software problems that we’ve been dealing with for 
                      years. Secure software design patterns can be used to model security controls 
                      at different trust boundaries within your architecture, providing security in 
                      a repeatable and consumable way. Using patterns such as the Service Mesh or 
                      Ambassador pattern lets us focus on proper security control placement and 
                      lifting security outside of the core services we’ve traditionally bolted 
                      security onto later.<br />
                      <br />
                      The goal of this presentation is to arm software developers and security 
                      architects with reference architecture guidance that can be used in any cloud 
                      native environment. The topics we’ll cover include multi-tenancy considerations, 
                      authentication, authorization, encryption, and more. We will focus on newer 
                      cloud native architecture patterns as well as some classic software design 
                      patterns that are still applicable. At the end of this presentation, you’ll have 
                      a greater understanding of cloud native security design at an architectural level 
                      and you’ll be eager to begin white-boarding your ideas.
