                      This presentation examines AI through a sociotechnical lens, focusing on 
                      security implications beyond traditional cybersecurity paradigms. AI 
                      systems are embedded within social structures involving hidden “ghost work“
                      from Global South communities, creating digital colonialism while consuming 
                      massive environmental resources. Sociotechnical risk analysis reveals 
                      vulnerabilities extending from technical attacks (adversarial examples, 
                      data poisoning) to social manipulation through deepfakes and weaponized 
                      misinformation. These risks are amplified by model opacity, concentrated 
                      capabilities, and the dangerous misalignment between AI’s actual 
                      pattern-recognition abilities and social perceptions of intelligence. Security 
                      professionals must understand that AI deployment creates new attack surfaces in 
                      critical infrastructure while being simultaneously promoted as security solutions. 
                      The presentation advocates for security frameworks that account for both technical 
                      vulnerabilities and social dimensions of AI risk, challenging hype-driven adoption 
                      that ignores fundamental limitations and sociotechnical dependencies
