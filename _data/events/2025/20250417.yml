    title           : Building a Robust AppSec Program&#58; SAMM's Roadmap to SSDLC Maturity
    start           : "20:05"
    end             : "20:50"
    abstract        : >-
                      In this talk, we will explore how the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model 
                      (SAMM) provides a structured approach to building and improving an 
                      organization's Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC). From assessing 
                      current AppSec practices to defining a practical roadmap for maturity, this 
                      talk will guide you through SAMM's core pillars and actionable best practices. 
                      Whether you’re just starting or looking to refine your AppSec program, this 
                      session offers insights into fostering sustainable change and aligning 
                      security with business objectives.
