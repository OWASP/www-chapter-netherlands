    title           : Our Secrets Management Journey&#58; From Code to Vault
    abstract        : >-
                      So you have an access key that you need to store somewhere. 
                      Maybe it is better not to put it in your code, nor in your 
                      container. But what about Kubernetes? What about a custom 
                      secrets storage solution? Of course, we tried many, sometimes 
                      funny, things to get our secrets secured. And luckily we ended 
                      up with a combination of safe methods, with Vault at its core. 
                      Want to know more? Join us, as we will go through various 
                      examples and their challenges!

    title           : Doing Security in DevOps, the right way!
    abstract        : >-
                      Automation is not DevSecOps, but without automation there is no 
                      DevSecOps! Secret management, SAST, DAST, Pen Testing, Container 
                      Security, Secure Config Management etc. are about automating 
                      security. But let me ask you, can one reach nirvana in securing 
                      DevOps with solely automation? This talk will address ALL dimensions 
                      required for doing security in DevOps, so we get it right!
