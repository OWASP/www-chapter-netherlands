                      Over the year 2021 the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) 
                      notified a total of 86,427 IP addresses that were found to be vulnerable. 
                      Compared to 58,358 e-mails in 2020, that is a growth of more that 33%. 
                      This year we already sent out 141,078 emails.<br />
                      The DIVD scans the internet for vulnerabilities and reports these to the 
                      people who can fix them. I will go into some of our recent cases, ranging 
                      from KaseyaVSA, to Log4j in 2021 and some of the 2022 highlights. Next to 
                      that you will get an introduction in how the DIVD has professionalise 
                      vulnerability disclosure and why we are allowed to somewhat break laws on 
                      computer crime and privacy.

                      NCSC-NL has a clear mission&#58; to make The Netherlands digitally secure. 
                      To achieve this, we need to understand what’s going on and connect all the 
                      relevant parties to exchange knowledge and provide a perspective for action, 
                      hopefully to prevent digital disruptions. But the NCSC does not own or 
                      control any part of the internet. We do not have actual buttons to push or 
                      knobs to turn. We need to make others do this for the greater good. Let’s 
                      take a dive into the efforts of the NCSC to help assess digital risks, help 
                      resolve vulnerabilities in systems and help respond to incidents.

                        Koen Sandbrink is a cyber security advisor for the National Cyber Security 
                        Centre of The Netherlands (NCSC-NL). Originally educated to make IT, he 
                        started his career as a security tester to break IT. In the following decade, 
                        he has seen too many things gone wrong and has developed a few opinions on 
                        how not to do those things anymore. Koen likes trains, architecture and 
                        classical music and is also convinced that Ludwig van Beethoven was a hacker.
