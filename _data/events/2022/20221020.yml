    title           : Attacking and Defending Kubernetes

    abstract        : >-
                      Organizations are increasingly moving to cloud-based managed Kubernetes 
                      deployments given the numerous benefits over self-managed deployments. 
                      However, it comes with different security and monitoring considerations. 
                      The reason behind these differences lies in the different management models 
                      used by different cloud service providers, which most of the time depend on 
                      the proposed Shared Responsibility Model.<br />
                      This talk discusses some common security misconfigurations for Kubernetes 
                      clusters and how attackers can exploit them via live demonstrations. We 
                      will then focus on a custom cloud-native security monitoring solution built 
                      in AWS. The goal is to alert relevant stakeholders of potential 
                      misconfigurations and active breach attempts on an Amazon EKS Cluster. As 
                      mentioned above, this talk includes <strong>live demonstrations</strong> of 
                      some of the use-cases that have been implemented. The implemented solution 
                      leverages AWS native tools, as well as an infrastructure-as-code template 
                      for rapid deployment across accounts. Finally, we discuss potential use 
                      cases for this solution and propose a general roadmap for improvements and 
                      future capabilities.<br />
                      This talk will be especially useful for individual contributors or professionals 
                      who want to understand and develop in-house security monitoring tools for 
                      Kubernetes without the need for expensive third-party platforms.
