    title           : Attacking and Defending Kubernetes
    start           : "19:15"
    end             : "20:00"

                      Organizations are increasingly moving to cloud-based managed Kubernetes 
                      deployments given the numerous benefits over self-managed deployments. 
                      However, it comes with different security and monitoring considerations. 
                      The reason behind these differences lies in the different management models 
                      used by different cloud service providers, which most of the time depend on 
                      the proposed Shared Responsibility Model.<br />
                      This talk discusses some common security misconfigurations for Kubernetes 
                      clusters and how attackers can exploit them via live demonstrations. We 
                      will then focus on a custom cloud-native security monitoring solution built 
                      in AWS. The goal is to alert relevant stakeholders of potential 
                      misconfigurations and active breach attempts on an Amazon EKS Cluster. As 
                      mentioned above, this talk includes <strong>live demonstrations</strong> of 
                      some of the use-cases that have been implemented. The implemented solution 
                      leverages AWS native tools, as well as an infrastructure-as-code template 
                      for rapid deployment across accounts. Finally, we discuss potential use 
                      cases for this solution and propose a general roadmap for improvements and 
                      future capabilities.<br />
                      This talk will be especially useful for individual contributors or professionals 
                      who want to understand and develop in-house security monitoring tools for 
                      Kubernetes without the need for expensive third-party platforms.

    title           : TIBER-EU, the European framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming
    start           : "20:15"
    end             : "21:00"
    abstract        : >-
                      The ECB launched the threat intelligence based ethical red teaming (TIBER-EU) framework 
                      some time ago. More and more central banks within Europe are adopting this framework to 
                      have their critical financial infrastructure tested against realistic threat. The 
                      presentation has a balanced mix of theory and examples from the field.<br />
                      Givan will share his view from the years of experience with developing the framework and 
                      leading many red teaming engagements under the different TIBER ‘flavors’. He will walk 
                      through the framework and explain how it ‘works’ and zooms in on the delivery of the red 
                      and purple teaming parts. Giving you a glance at what is involved in performing a 
                      realistic attack on live critical systems of a large financial institution.
