    title           : OWASP Dependency Track and OWASP CycloneDX
    abstract        : >-
                      Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) have gained wide-spread support from the software 
                      industry, to critical infrastructure, to the White House. In this session, the OWASP 
                      CycloneDX SBOM standard will be introduced along with strategies for effectively 
                      creating SBOMs. Also introduced will be OWASP Dependency-Track, a platform that 
                      consumes and continuously analyzes SBOMs for security, operational, and license risk. 
                      Both of these flagship OWASP projects work together to allow organizations to make 
                      better risk-based decisions.

    title           : Software Bill of Material – why do we need it, what is it and how can we overcome the current challenges
    abstract        : >-
                      The Executive Order on Cybersecurity of the Biden administration caused a lot of activity 
                      on the ‘software bill of material’. This talk will go into the details why it is being asked, 
                      what it consists of, and the practical challenges the industry needs to solve to reliably 
                      and efficiently create and use it in an automated way.
