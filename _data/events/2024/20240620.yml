                      “The more I know about how software is made, the less I want to know” - Me<br />
                      <br />
                      As a software developer with over a decade of experience and countless 
                      interactions with application security teams, I've discovered the unsettling 
                      complexities of modern software production. Despite what I thought I knew, the 
                      reality was far more intricate.<br />
                      <br />
                      Modern software development is a sprawling network of open-source dependencies, 
                      sophisticated build tools, plugins, pipelines, and runtimes. These components 
                      are fundamental in securing critical sectors of our daily lives—finance, 
                      healthcare, infrastructure, transportation, and social interactions. However, 
                      this supply chain is under relentless attack and many of the potential threats 
                      are poorly understood.<br />
                      <br />
                      This talk will delve into specific vulnerabilities, such as dependency poisoning 
                      and pipeline compromises, that exemplify the challenges we face. We'll explore 
                      strategies to mitigate these threats and discuss practical takeaways that 
                      attendees can immediately implement in their software development practices. 
                      Expect to leave with a deeper understanding of supply chain security and with 
                      ideas to fortify your software factory against these escalating threats.

      bio           : >-
                      David Archer is a Solution Architect at Endor Labs. He began his career as a 
                      software developer and witnessed significant shifts in how software is built 
                      over the last two decades. After spells as a development lead, product director 
                      and pre-sales consultancy roles David consistently saw a concerning trend&#58; 
                      security often took a backseat amidst the hustle and bustle of development 
                      priorities.<br />
                      <br />
                      Seeking to help address this balance David took an opportunity in 2018 to work 
                      full-time in the field of application security with a particular focus on 
                      technologies that promise to enhance security without impeding development 
                      speed. Through his extensive experience with secure coding practises and 
                      hands-on experience with the myriad of code analysis tools like IAST, SAST, 
                      DAST, RASP and SCA, he gained valuable insights into their relevance and 
                      effectiveness in a modern software factory.

    abstract        : >-
                      Modern applications are build upon a large supply chain of (possibly open 
                      source) libraries and tools. In finance, leverage is the ratio of debts 
                      (other people's money) vs equity (your money) and the Lehman Brothers have 
                      made that concept famous. For software, technical leverage is the ratio between 
                      other people's code and your own code. I will argue with some examples from the 
                      Maven, Python and the NPM ecosystems that this is both a risk and an 
                      opportunity. The Lehmans Brothers were 30 to 1, what about the Software 
                      Sisters?

                      Fabio Massacci is a co-author of CVSS v4. Among other things, he is also a 
                      professor at Vrije Universiteit. He has been a speaker at hackers’ venues 
                      (BlackHat USA, Asia) scientific security conferences (IEEE S&P, CCS), software 
                      engineering (ICSE,MSR) and risk analysis (SRA). He coordinates the EU project 
                      Sec4AI4Sec (name tells it all) and an NWO project on using AI for security 
                      threat intelligence. While almost all professors are sellers of tech (through 
                      their papers or their spin-offs) he was also for 7 years deputy for ICT 
                      procurements and services supervising a 70+ workforce and few millions Euro in 
                      outsourcing contracts. Being a buyer of tech makes a difference in perspective.
