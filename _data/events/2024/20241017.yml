                      AI is rapidly transforming software development, offering 
                      unprecedented capabilities but also introducing new security 
                      challenges. As organizations rush to adopt AI technologies, they 
                      often overlook critical security implications, potentially exposing 
                      themselves to novel threats and vulnerabilities.<br />
                      In this talk, we'll explore how to build secure AI-powered software, 
                      covering both coding practices and system design. We'll dive into 
                      specific scenarios where AI can introduce security risks and discuss 
                      practical strategies to mitigate these issues in software development. 
                      We'll also touch on privacy concerns when implementing AI solutions. 
                      Through real-world examples, you'll gain actionable insights to 
                      enhance the security of your AI projects, from individual algorithms 
                      to complete systems.
