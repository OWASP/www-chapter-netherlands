                      AI is rapidly transforming software development, offering 
                      unprecedented capabilities but also introducing new security 
                      challenges. As organizations rush to adopt AI technologies, they 
                      often overlook critical security implications, potentially exposing 
                      themselves to novel threats and vulnerabilities.<br />
                      In this talk, we'll explore how to build secure AI-powered software, 
                      covering both coding practices and system design. We'll dive into 
                      specific scenarios where AI can introduce security risks and discuss 
                      practical strategies to mitigate these issues in software development. 
                      We'll also touch on privacy concerns when implementing AI solutions. 
                      Through real-world examples, you'll gain actionable insights to 
                      enhance the security of your AI projects, from individual algorithms 
                      to complete systems.

    title           : Securing GenAI Applications - a Point of View
    start           : "20:15"

                      The POV discusses the importance of securing generative AI (GenAI) 
                      and the challenges associated with it. GenAI empowers organizations 
                      to unlock new opportunities, drive innovation, and deliver value in 
                      an increasingly digital and dynamic world. However, securing GenAI 
                      introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including 
                      adversarial risks across the AI pipeline, data privacy and security 
                      concerns, and the need for a unified approach to security. The POV 
                      highlights the importance of understanding the risks associated with 
                      input, training, and output data, as well as the need for data 
                      provenance, transparency, and accountability. Further to this, it 
                      looks into the risks posed by use of GenAI, the importance of 
                      security in a GenAI strategy, and how we need to go about mitigating 
                      risks in practice; factoring in the different GenAI consumption 
                      models and the impact these will have on Security Management.<br />
                      The POV concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding 
                      GenAI's risks and challenges and taking a proactive approach to 
                      securing it.
