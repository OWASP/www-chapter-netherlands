                      APIs play a central role in today's economy, powering the exchange of data and 
                      services between applications and businesses. However, with great power comes 
                      great responsibility, and API security is more critical than ever.<br />
                      <br />
                      In this session, we will discuss the OWASP API Security Top 10, a comprehensive 
                      guide to the most critical API security risks which was first released in 2019 
                      and updated in 2023. We will then dive into real-world examples of API security 
                      issues found on well-known solutions powered by APIs, providing a detailed 
                      analysis of the vulnerabilities and the impact they could have had on the 
                      affected organizations.<br />
                      <br />
                      By the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of the 
                      importance of API security and the steps you can take to protect your 
                      organization's APIs from attacks.

                      If you want to bring an app to production, you need to know where to put your 
                      secrets and how to access them safely. In this session, we'll go into how to 
                      *not* use secrets with a purposefully vulnerable application. We hope you'll 
                      take this knowledge and not make the same mistakes in your own app. Of course, 
                      you'll also learn a thing or two on how to do secrets management properly. 
                      Alternatively, you can use this app to teach others!
