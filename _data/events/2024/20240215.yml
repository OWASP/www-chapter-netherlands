                      ModSecurity is an open-source, cross-platform web application firewall (WAF) 
                      engine. Originally written by Ivan Ristić, it was acquired by Trustwave and 
                      then developed for over 10 years by Trustwave's SpiderLabs.<br />
                      <br />
                      ModSecurity exists as a module for the Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and IIS 
                      (v2) and it has also been released as standalone daemon for NGINX (v3), 
                      accessible via an API and a webserver specific connector module. It is able 
                      to inspect HTTP requests and HTTP responses and it configured via rules in a 
                      rather cumbersome config language called "SecLang". OWASP CRS is the dominant 
                      rules project used by most ModSecurity users.<br />
                      <br />
                      In 2021, Trustwave announced the end of support and the plan to hand over 
                      ModSecurity into the hands of the community by Summer 2024. OWASP tried to 
                      convince Trustwave to hand it over to the foundation several times, but only 
                      succeeded in November 2023. A plan was thus drawn and a new project was 
                      prepared from December 2023. The main repository was transferred on January 25 
                      and OWASP ModSecurity was declared a "production level" OWASP project by the 
                      OWASP project committee.<br />
                      <br />
                      The new project operates with a preliminary leader team, the first release is 
                      already out and the community is growing, all in line with the 3-6 month 
                      project plan drawn up in December 2023.<br />
                      <br />
                      This talk gives an overview of this dynamics at play, how OWASP operates on 
                      projects like this and the perspectives are for ModSecurity and OWASP as a 
                      whole.

                      Since its inception over a decade ago, OWASP Dependency-Track has pioneered many 
                      concepts in the realm of software supply chain security, and software bill of 
                      materials (SBOM).<br />
                      <br />
                      With increasingly more governments, regulators and organizations asking for SBOMs, 
                      the project is more relevant than ever. On the other hand, a non-negligible 
                      portion of folks is still puzzled as to what to even do with SBOMs once they have 
                      them.<br />
                      <br />
                      In this talk, we'll explore what Dependency-Track is, how it can help organizations 
                      in identifying and reducing risk in their software supply chain, and give an 
                      outlook into what's next!
