    title           : OWASP Dependency-Track
    abstract        : >-
                      Since its inception over a decade ago, OWASP Dependency-Track has pioneered many 
                      concepts in the realm of software supply chain security, and software bill of 
                      materials (SBOM).<br />
                      <br />
                      With increasingly more governments, regulators and organizations asking for SBOMs, 
                      the project is more relevant than ever. On the other hand, a non-negligible 
                      portion of folks is still puzzled as to what to even do with SBOMs once they have 
                      them.<br />
                      <br />
                      In this talk, we'll explore what Dependency-Track is, how it can help organizations 
                      in identifying and reducing risk in their software supply chain, and give an 
                      outlook into what's next!
