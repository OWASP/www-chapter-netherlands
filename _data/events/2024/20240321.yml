    title           : How to get Dev(Ops) teams to start adopting DevSecOps

                      In many development environments, security has long been seen as an 
                      afterthought or even a right-out hindrance. And forcing security onto 
                      developers often has an adverse effect. In this talk we will share the 
                      journey we have been making at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) to 
                      get Development teams to adopt DevSecOps in a way that works best for 
                      them. Topics that will be discussed include Secure Development training, 
                      Security Champions, Threat Modeling and using the right tooling.

      bio             : >-
                        Sebastiaan Rijnbout has a background as .NET developer and has worked 
                        in that field for over 12 years, but since 2017 he has started focusing 
                        on AppSec and Dev(Sec)Ops.<br />
                        <br />
                        When getting teams and organisations to adopt DevSecOps, Sebastiaan will 
                        look at all aspects of DevSecOps (People, Process and Technology) like 
                        setting up developer training programs and security champion programs, 
                        rolling out company-wide Security tooling and improving working processes. 
                        But always keeping a focus on making things easy and efficient for 
                        developers.<br />
                        <br />
                        In his current role at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) Sebastiaan 
                        acts as Product Owner for 4 Dev(Sec)Ops support teams. These teams are 
                        responsible for enabling all development teams at KVK to deliver secure 
                        and high-quality software as efficiently as possible.

    title           : Cracking the API&#58; Challenges in IoT and Modern Applications
    start           : "20:15"

                      Securing API's is about more than just an endpoint, it's about the data 
                      shared, customer privacy, and the access we give to unauthorised parties. 
                      Now as we are connecting more devices than ever, to more third parties 
                      than ever, securing APIs needs an offensive mindset from the design phase.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      In this talk I'll go over some of the techniques I use when testing, common 
                      issues I've found and their impact, and the state of IoT and modern 
                      web applications. <br />
                      <br />
                      Security issues can arise from misconceptions early in the software process, 
                      so I'll also discuss how we might mitigate some of these with thoughtful 
                      design, architecture and development.
