**Martijn Baalman aka @x1m_martijn - "Recon Recon":**  
In the daytime, Martijn is a pen tester at Qbit Cyber Security, and by night he is bug bounty hunting in the wild and sending PoCs to Detectify Crowdsource and other bug bounty platforms. Recon is key for finding vulnerabilities yet is tedious at times. Hackers, like developers, find that automation makes life easier, even recon. Martijn has developed something called ReconPi, a bug bounty reconnaissance tool that automates most of the (general) recon methods that hackers use. Heâ€™ll show you how he does all his recon, yes everything, on a Raspberry Pi 3 in his lightning talk.

**Chrissy Morgan aka 5w0rdFish - "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Responsible Disclosure."**  
So what's has a JQuery bug that affected thousands of websites with one of the highest starred GitHub repos with 7,800 forks, a Domain Name Registrar vulnerability which allowed for full access to domain owner details (post GDPR) and data protection flaws within Microsoft's Office365 all have in common? ... Answer: Responsible Disclosure. This talk will feature disclosure on each of the bugs and others, the circumstances around these when reporting, to highlight the problems security researchers face today when trying to do the right thing and to raise awareness of the security flaws so we are better protected.
