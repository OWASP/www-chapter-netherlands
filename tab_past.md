18:30 - 19:00 Dinner  
19:00 - 19:15 Welcome  
19:15 - 20:00 Recon Recon by Martijn Baalman  
20:00 - 20:15 Break  
20:15 - 21:00 The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Responsible Disclosure by Chrissy Morgan  
21:00 - Closing and networking  

**Spaces Herengracht**  
Herengracht 124-128,  
1015 BT Amsterdam

**Martijn Baalman aka @x1m_martijn - "Recon Recon":**  
In the daytime, Martijn is a pen tester at Qbit Cyber Security, and by night he is bug bounty hunting in the wild and sending PoCs to Detectify Crowdsource and other bug bounty platforms. Recon is key for finding vulnerabilities yet is tedious at times. Hackers, like developers, find that automation makes life easier, even recon. Martijn has developed something called ReconPi, a bug bounty reconnaissance tool that automates most of the (general) recon methods that hackers use. He’ll show you how he does all his recon, yes everything, on a Raspberry Pi 3 in his lightning talk.

**Chrissy Morgan aka 5w0rdFish - "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Responsible Disclosure."**  
So what's has a JQuery bug that affected thousands of websites with one of the highest starred GitHub repos with 7,800 forks, a Domain Name Registrar vulnerability which allowed for full access to domain owner details (post GDPR) and data protection flaws within Microsoft's Office365 all have in common? ... Answer: Responsible Disclosure. This talk will feature disclosure on each of the bugs and others, the circumstances around these when reporting, to highlight the problems security researchers face today when trying to do the right thing and to raise awareness of the security flaws so we are better protected.

About Chrissy:  
Chrissy leads the IT Security Operations for a Close Protection company and in her spare time Chrissy has carried out research in the areas of web application security, Steganography, RFID, Physical Cyber Systems Security and is actively involved within the information security community across a wealth of subjects. She also runs The Co-Lab in London, which is a hardware hacking security research workshop. As a recent Napier Masters Graduate, she has accomplished the following successes so far: Winner of Cyber Security Challenge UK (University Challenge - Team Edinburgh Napier), CTF Finalist for the Pragyan CTF (Team Edinburgh Napier) , A BlackHat Challenge Coin winner for OSINT from Social Engineer.org and Black Hat Scholarship, Steelcon Award, WISP Sponsorship, was the BSides London Rookie Track Speaker Winner for 2018 and most recently won the ISC(2) Up and coming Security Professional 2019.

19:00 - 19:15 Welcome, OWASP update  
19:15 - 20:00 Machine Learning vs. Cryptocoin Miners by Jonn Callahan  
20:00 - 2-:15: Break  
20:15 - 21:00 Running at Light Speed: Cloud Native Security Patterns by Jack Mannino

**Machine Learning vs. Cryptocoin Miners:**  
With the advent of cryptocurrencies as a prevalent economic entity, attackers have begun turning compromised boxes and environments into cash via cryptocoin mining. This has given rise for the necessity to detect compromised environments by analyzing network traffic logs for evidence of cryptocoin miners operating within a given network. In this talk, I'll be reviewing various ML and statistical analysis techniques leveraged against VPC Flow Logs for this very purpose. It will not be a deep dive of the math involved, but instead a general discussion of these techniques and why I chose them.

**Running at Light Speed: Cloud Native Security Patterns**  
No matter how fast you ship software, a good design is critical to security. Cloud native systems are no exception. Containerized microservices running on distributed management and orchestration platforms, bring new challenges to address as well as classic software problems that we’ve been dealing with for years. Secure software design patterns can be used to model security controls at different trust boundaries within your architecture, providing security in a repeatable and consumable way. Using patterns such as the Service Mesh or Ambassador pattern lets us focus on proper security control placement and lifting security outside of the core services we’ve traditionally bolted security onto later.

The goal of this presentation is to arm software developers and security architects with reference architecture guidance that can be used in any cloud native environment. The topics we’ll cover include multi-tenancy considerations, authentication, authorization, encryption, and more. We will focus on newer cloud native architecture patterns as well as some classic software design patterns that are still applicable. At the end of this presentation, you’ll have a greater understanding of cloud native security design at an architectural level and you’ll be eager to begin white-boarding your ideas.

Speakers info: Jonn Callahan has worked in appsec for half a decade across a wide variety of languages, technologies, and sectors. While constantly looking for new things to play with, he rediscovered his love for the universal language of math and, consequentially, the power of statistical analysis and machine learning. He now seeks to dismantle the black magic of these techniques, showing that they don't require an advanced mathematics degree to be leveraged, as well as to find novel ways to apply them within the security space Jack Mannino is the CEO of nVisium. Passionate about security and impossible to keep away from a keyboard, his expertise spans over 15 years of building, breaking, and securing software. Jack founded nVisium in 2009, and since then has helped the world's largest software teams enhance security across their software portfolios. He has spoken at conferences globally on topics such as secure design, mobile application security, and cloud-native security.
