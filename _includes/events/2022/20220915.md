### Digitally securing The Netherlands - or convincing others to do it
##### Abstract:
NCSC-NL has a clear mission: to make The Netherlands digitally secure. To achieve this, we need to understand what's going on and connect all the relevant parties to exchange knowledge and provide a perspective for action, hopefully to prevent digital disruptions. But the NCSC does not own or control any part of the internet. We do not have actual buttons to push or knobs to turn. We need to make others do this for the greater good. Let's take a dive into the efforts of the NCSC to help assess digital risks, help resolve vulnerabilities in systems and help respond to incidents.
##### Bio:
Koen Sandbrink is a cyber security advisor for the National Cyber Security Centre of The Netherlands (NCSC-NL). Originally educated to make IT, he started his career as a security tester to break IT. In the following decade, he has seen too many things gone wrong and has developed a few opinions on how not to do those things anymore. Koen likes trains, architecture and classical music and is also convinced that Ludwig van Beethoven was a hacker.
