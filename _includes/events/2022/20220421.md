#### Crawl Dutch government websites to collect statistics of SRI usage
##### Abstract:
In this work we crawled all major Dutch govern-
ment websites to measure the adoption rate of Subresource
Integrity Protection (SRI). We crawled and evaluated close
to 150,000 different pages on 477 different domains using a
crawler that we developed. This resulted in approximately
1,000,000 different cross origin script and link tags being
evaluated. We found the adoption rate of SRI to be very
low with 8.4% of the tags having implemented SRI. For
sensitive pages, such as login and registration pages, this
number was slightly lower at 8.3%. Our findings indicate
that most of these SRI enabled references are due to
Content Delivery Networks (CDN’s) and utility providers providing
HTML resource links already with proper integrity and
crossorigin attributes. This is due to CDN’s and utility
providers being the most popular SRI enabled domains to
reference to in combination with almost
no Dutch government websites having complete SRI cover-
age in their cross origin resource references.
