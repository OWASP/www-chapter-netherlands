#### Comparing Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools en dependency scanners
##### Abstract:
There are many SAST tools and dependency scanners in the market. In this talk, the comparison results will be discussed of some SAST tools and dependency scanners. The comparison includes human experiences like usability and developer friendliness, but also metrics like true and false positives and overlapping reports between the tools. Tools that were compared are: SonarQube, Npm audit, FindSecurityBugs, Snyk, Semgrep, ShiftLeft Scan, OWASP Dependency Check, and OSS Index. The comparison was performed by scanning a ready-for-market Java-React web application.
