#### How log4j ruined our Christmas 
##### Abstract:
Early December a vulnerability was found in Log4j, an open-source logging library commonly used by apps and services across the internet. If left unfixed, attackers can break into systems, steal passwords and logins, extract data, and infect networks with malicious software.

This talk will outline why this vulnerability ruined Christmas and the potential impact log4j can or could have to your organisation.
